Databases cater to various user roles, including Data Engineers, Database Administrators (DBAs), Data Scientists, Analysts, and Application Developers.

Data Engineers/DBAs manage databases using GUIs, command line interfaces, and APIs for administrative tasks.

Open-source relational databases have gained popularity, reaching approximately 50% in the past decade, while cloud databases offer increased scalability and data accessibility.

Db2 is a versatile family of products deployable across various platforms, providing high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability.

MySQL supports various programming languages and is a reliable, scalable, and widely adopted database system compatible with UNIX, Windows, and Linux.

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database supporting a range of languages for client application development, including features for handling relational, structured, and non-structured data.
