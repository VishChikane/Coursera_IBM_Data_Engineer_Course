you learned that 
An ERD is a graphical representation of the entities and the relationships between them in a database.
ERD components include entities, attributes, and relationships.
Relational databases organize data into tables with relationships based on common fields.
Entities become tables with the same name and attributes become columns within those tables. 

Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point, you know that:

There are three main data categories. These include: structured, unstructured, and semi-structured.

Data repositories store and manage data centrally, including relational and non-relational databases.

Information Models provide abstract representations of entities and relationships, whereas Data Models serve as blueprints for practical database structures.

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation that illustrates the relationships and interactions between entities in a database.

The fundamental components that form the structure of a relationship include entities, relationship sets, and crowâ€™s foot notations.

Varchar, an abbreviation for variable character, is a data type that stores character strings.

Sets characterized by their unordered collections include operations such as membership, subsets, union, and intersection.

Relations describe connections between set elements and consist of two essential components: The Relation Schema and the Relation Instance.
