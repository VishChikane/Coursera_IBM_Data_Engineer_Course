MySQL, renowned for its scalability and reliability, is an open-source RDBMS available in various forms, including a free community edition, commercial version, and cloud deployment.

Key administration tools for MySQL management include MySQL CLI, MySQL Workbench, and phpMyAdmin.

MySQL CLI enables interaction with the MySQL server and data via commands, while MySQL Workbench integrates SQL development, administration, and design tasks.

phpMyAdmin, a web-based GUI, is popular among web hosting providers and individual website owners for MySQL management.

Database and table creation in MySQL can be accomplished through command line interfaces, graphical user interfaces, or API calls.

phpMyAdmin offers an intuitive interface for creating databases, tables, and columns, allowing for easy addition and modification of post-table creation.

Backup and restore functionality, available both via command line and phpMyAdmin, facilitates database population.

For small data inserts, phpMyAdmin provides a convenient manual insertion method.

Import and export functionalities, accessible through the command line and phpMyAdmin, aid in table population and data saving to files.

Primary keys in MySQL are established by defining a primary index on one or more columns, and autoincrement can be used to generate sequential numeric data in a column.

When creating foreign keys, actions like ON DELETE and ON UPDATE can be defined.

By default, columns in MySQL tables within phpMyAdmin are set to NOT NULL.

Columns can be configured to accept only unique values in MySQL setups.

PostgreSQL, known for its reliability and flexibility, is an open-source database system with deployment options including local installation, virtualization, containerization, and cloud services.

Connectivity to PostgreSQL databases is facilitated by tools like psql and pgAdmin, as well as commercial options and managed services.

psql serves as the default command-line interface for PostgreSQL interaction, while pgAdmin offers a comprehensive platform featuring a Query Tool and ERD Tool for visual design.

Various tools, including psql and pgAdmin, can be used to create PostgreSQL objects.

Database backups and restoration in PostgreSQL can be performed using pg_dump and psql.

The pgAdmin Import/Export tool aids in loading data into tables and exporting data from them.

Views, another method of data presentation from one or more tables, can be utilized to restrict access to sensitive data and simplify data retrieval.

Materialized views store result sets for fast access but do not support insertion, updating, or deletion of rows.
