Querying SQLite3 database
What is SQLite3?

SQLite3 is an in-process Python library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a popular choice as an embedded database for local/client storage in application software.

How to connect to the SQLite3?
You can connect to SQLIte3 using the connect() function by passing the required database name as an argument.

import sqlite3
sql_connection = sqlite3.connect(‘database.db’)

This makes the variable sql_connection an object of the SQL code engine. You can then use this to run the required queries on the database.

How to create a database table using SQLite3 and Pandas?
You can directly load a Pandas dataframe to a SQLite3 database object using the following syntax.

df.to_sql(table_name, sql_connection, if_exists = 'replace', index = False)

Here, you use the to_sql() function to convert the pandas dataframe to an SQL table.

The table_name and sql_connection arguments specify the name of the required table and the database to which you should load the dataframe.

The if_exists parameter can take any one of three possible values:
'fail': This denies the creation of a table if one with the same name exists in the database already.
'replace': This overwrites the existing table with the same name.
'append': This adds information to the existing table with the same name.

Keep the index parameter set to True only if the index of the data being sent holds some informational value. Otherwise, keep it as False.

How to query a database table using SQLite3 and Pandas?
You can use the Pandas function read_sql() to query a database table.

The function returns a Pandas dataframe with the output to the query. Use the function with the following syntax:

df = pandas.read_sql(query_statement, sql_connection)
Here, the query_statement argument contains the complete query to the required table as a string.
