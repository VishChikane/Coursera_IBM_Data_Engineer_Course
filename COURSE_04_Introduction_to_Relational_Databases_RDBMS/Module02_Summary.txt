Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point, you know that:

DDL (Data Definition Language) statements, such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, are used for defining, modifying, and deleting objects in a database, like tables and their attributes.

When creating tables, key considerations involve selecting a schema, defining columns with names, datatypes, and optional values like primary key constraints, and referencing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

Methods for creating tables include using visual interfaces like the Db2 on Cloud console, SQL statements, and administrative APIs.

Post-creation actions may include generating SQL code, modifying table structure, exploring dependencies, and dropping the table if necessary.

Data manipulation involves DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements for working with data within tables, such as inserting, updating, deleting, or querying records.

Data movement tasks include populating databases initially, adding or appending data, making copies for development tests or disaster recovery, and ensuring scalability.

Utilities like BACKUP and RESTORE are used to create and recover copies of entire databases, including tables, views, constraints, and their data.

The IMPORT utility facilitates inserting data into tables from different formats like DEL/CSV, ASC, and IXF, while the EXPORT utility saves table data into various formats like CSV.

LOAD utilities enable high-performance insertion of large volumes of data into specified tables, offering quicker and more efficient data loading compared to multiple INSERT statements.

Loading data can be done from various sources, including delimited text files and Cloud Object Storage, and can be managed through user-friendly interfaces like the Load Data utility in the Db2 Web Console.
